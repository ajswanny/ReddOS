#  ReddOS
ReddOS (Reddit Operating System) is a simple Reddit client. It is read-only, and allows a user to log in and view their front 
page of content and the list of Subreddits they are subscribed to.

If you are cloning this project for the first time, it comes logged in already with a debug account. If you wish, you may logout of 
this account and try logging in with your own account!
